### How to be a successful programmer:
  - you should understand the purpose of the software 
  - the purpose of the software is not to show off how intelligent you are but to help people 
  - Your design should be easy for you and helpful for others.
  - Bad developers don’t understand what they are doing, and good developers do
  - A good programmer writes code in a simple way that other      programmers can easily understand
  - Your main purpose is to control complexity, not to create it.
  -  It is more important to reduce the effort of maintenance than it is to reduce the effort of implementation.
  - Inconsistent code is difficult to understand. So a good programmer makes the website consistent
  - Changes that will bring you a lot of value and require little effort are better than those that will bring you little value and require a lot of effort.
  - Don’t hesitate to ask for help.
  - Keep up with development and read books on software development
